# This is an example of simple web scraping bot.

The bot automatically opens the google chrome and enters the website - www.booking.com.

As a default, it changes the currency to USD, place to New York and adds the dates and number of guests then clicks on the search button.

In the next webpage, it applies filters like "stars", "Lowest price" then shows all possible places to stay.

This bot can be improved to get very precise resuslts.

In this project, I have used Selenium for automation.
